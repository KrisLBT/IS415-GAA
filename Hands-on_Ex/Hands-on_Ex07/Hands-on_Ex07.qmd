# Introduction

Spatial Point Pattern Analysis is the evaluation of the distribution of a set of points on a surface. It can be used to analyse the spatial distribution of crime, traffic, disease and physical facilities.

In this hands-on exercise, I will be answering the following questions:

-   are the childcare centres in Singapore randomly distributed throughout the country?

-   if the answer is not, then the next logical question is where are the locations with higher concentration of childcare centres?
