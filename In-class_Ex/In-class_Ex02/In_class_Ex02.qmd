# Overview

In this exercise, we will be using the Grab Polisi data downloaded the previous week.

# Getting started

## Folder creation

Using the file navigation in RStudio, create a new subdirectory for the second in-class exercise.

## Package installation

The following packages will be used and loaded in the R environment for this exercise:

-   arrow

-   lubridate

-   tmap

-   tidyverse

Code chunk:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(arrow, lubridate, tmap, tidyverse, sf)
```

Note: saw callout notes on prof's code, thought it looked cool. I can access it from the Visual tab but being able to write it in the source code seemed useful so I don't have to constantly toggle between the two modes
